# ogre [![Build Status](https://jenkins.adc4gis.com/buildStatus/icon?job=ogre)](https://jenkins.adc4gis.com/job/ogre/)

The instructions below are only if you are interested in running the project locally.  For help on how to use the web service, visit the [Ogre homepage](http://ogre.adc4gis.com).  Ogre makes use of the [ogr2ogr](https://github.com/wavded/ogr2ogr) module.

## Requirements

ogr2ogr requires the command line tool *ogr2ogr* - [gdal install page](http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/DownloadingGdalBinaries).
It is recommended to use the latest version.

## Installation

    npm install -g ogre

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/ogre.png?downloads=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/ogre)

For specific OS installation help, see the [wiki](https://github.com/wavded/ogre/wiki).

## Running

To run the app:

    ogre -p 3000 [options]

Options:
    --format=fmt    set output format (defaults to: "GeoJSON")
    --timeout=ms    milliseconds before ogr2ogr is killed (defaults to: 15000)
    --skipfailures  skip failures (continue after failure, skipping failed feature -- false by default)
